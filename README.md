To configure for use, you must create your own `secrets.py` file based off the `secrets_template.py` file. All you need to do is define `irc_server` and `irc_channel` then you're good to go.

To run a bot, run from the terminal with `python bot_script.py`.

Follow the pattern of `bot_template.py` for making new bots.

You can find IRC commands to use [here](https://wiki.inspircd.org/Commands).
